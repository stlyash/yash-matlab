## Auto-Sleep Using Matlab
This matlab program uses Machine Learning to identify the user and if no one is using the system, it triggers a function which automatically presses ```Win + X``` followed by ```U``` and ```S``` to make the system sleep. <br>
This program can be further modified to let specific users use the system and when someone else tries using it, it will sleep. <br>
